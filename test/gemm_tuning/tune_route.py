"""Measure decode-GEMV backends at the served models' real shapes, cold-cache.

Run as ``tune_route.py [shape_set] [route.json]``; the set names a key of
``_bench.SHAPE_SETS`` and defaults to K3's TP16 table.
The shapes are the exact (N, K) that the decode path hands the routed GEMV,
extracted from a trace of the serving path (rowcta's launch grid is ``(N,)``,
so gridX identifies each call site). Every measurement cycles through
NUM_COPIES independent weight tensors so the L2 never holds the operand between
calls, which is the state the serving path hands each shape.

A backend earns a routing entry only by beating the incumbent (the kernel
dispatch picks today) by at least MARGIN.
Emits the MEASURED_ROUTE dict for ops/gemm/routed_gemv.py.
