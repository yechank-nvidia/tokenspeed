"""Breakable CUDA graph capture for variable-shape (prefill / extend) forwards.

A *breakable* CUDA graph captures a forward as an ordered list of zero-arg
callables -- each is either a captured ``CUDAGraph.replay`` (a "graph segment")
or an eager Python function (a "break"). At designated break points (attention /
KV-cache ops, whose metadata is data-dependent and cannot be captured) the
current stream capture is ended, the op runs eagerly, and a fresh segment begins
capturing the remainder. Replay simply calls each segment in order.

This is the ``torch.compile``-free alternative to piecewise CUDA graphs. The
design is gratefully adapted from vLLM and SGLang, who pioneered the breakable
prefill graph: vLLM's ``BreakableCUDAGraphWrapper`` (the homogeneous segment-list
structure + the ``set_forward_context``/``get_forward_context`` ambient pattern we
mirror in :func:`active_forward`/:func:`current_forward_ctx`) and SGLang's
breakable prefill graph (the eager-copy output handoff at each break). Unlike a
full prefill graph, attention -- the only batch/length-aware op and the source of
the host-side ``max_seq_len_q`` scalar -- stays eager, so it never enters a graph.
Keeping all KV-cache reads/writes in the eager breaks also makes them honor the
per-layer transfer consumer index naturally.

Address-stability contract (the load-bearing invariant):

* All segments share one CUDA mempool, so graph-allocated intermediates keep
  stable device addresses across replays.
* The runner must copy live inputs into the *same* static input buffers used at
  capture before calling :meth:`BreakableCapture.replay`.
* Break-point outputs must land at the *same* address each replay. We achieve
  this by allocating a destination buffer in the captured segment (pool-pinned)
  and copying the eager op's result into it; the next segment reads that address.
