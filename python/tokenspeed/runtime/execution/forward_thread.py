"""The per-rank forward thread: the engine's single data plane.

The event loop is the CONTROL plane: ZMQ input, gloo collectives, the C++
scheduler, and commit post-processing. Dispatching a round never waits on
the GPU — it submits and moves on, and only commit joins — so a round is
microseconds and the cross-rank collectives that keep the redundant
schedulers aligned (request broadcast, DP sync) always find every rank
promptly, no matter how deep the GPUs are in queued work. (``DeviceHandle``
does have blocking ``run_*`` operations, but only on rounds that dispatch
nothing — the DP idle forward — or off the round path entirely.)

Everything that touches CUDA is therefore submitted here and runs on ONE
thread per rank, in submission order:

- model forwards (eager launches, graph replays, idle forwards),
- pipeline-stage NCCL recv/send,
- KV page zeroing, and KV buffer repair after a memory-saver wake,
- the PD receive trigger and the writes a completed remote prefill lands,
- in-place weight updates from an RL trainer.

One thread, one ordering: NCCL collectives on a shared communicator are
issued in the same order on every rank because every rank enqueues the same
work sequence (the redundant schedulers plan identically), and a stage's
launch-queue backpressure or a blocking stage recv stalls only this thread,
never the control plane. This is the FluentLLM ForwardThread design point,
generalized to every mode: depth 0/1/pp_size only changes how long a result
future may stay unresolved, not where work runs.

Why a thread and not a process: the forward work reads the executor's device
buffers, CUDA graphs, and NCCL communicators in place. A process would need
its own CUDA context and communicator clones plus an IPC copy of every
batch's metadata — the cost and failure modes of a second engine. The GIL is
not a bottleneck here: the thread spends its time inside CUDA launches and
NCCL waits, which release the GIL.

The capture contract
--------------------

Sharing an address space is a convenience, not a licence: the two planes
exchange information ONLY through the two channels below, so that the day
this becomes a process the interface is already the whole interface.

1. Outbound is the closure, and only the closure. The control plane hands
   work over as ``submit(fn)`` / ``run(fn)`` arguments captured in ``fn``.
   Passing something by parking it on a shared object — a field on the
   executor, on an attention backend, on a request state — is not a channel;
   it is a race waiting for a deep enough queue.

2. Captured means frozen. Submission is fire-and-forget: once ``fn`` is
   queued, the control plane must not mutate what it captured — no attribute
   rebinding, no in-place edit, no releasing a resource the object holds.
   Capture CPU-plain values, or a snapshot the control plane will only read
   afterwards. Bind at capture time (``functools.partial``, or a default
   argument) rather than closing over a variable the caller will rebind — a
   bare lambda reads it at execution time, possibly a round later.

3. Inbound is the future, and only the future. Results reach the control
   plane through ``PendingExecution.result()``; nothing else crosses back.

4. Device-side state is not reachable from the control plane at all. The
   execution stream, ``runtime_states``, ``input_buffers``, and every
   attention backend's forward metadata live behind ``DeviceHandle``
   (``device.py``), which is what the event loop holds instead of the
   executor and which hands back no device object at all. Rules 1 and 2 are
   enforced by that shape rather than by anyone remembering them: what the
   loop cannot see, it cannot pass implicitly or mutate afterwards.

5. Two registered exceptions — and new ones belong in this list, not in a
   comment at the call site:

   - Grammar matchers. ``GrammarStepInputs.grammars`` holds the control
     plane's live matcher objects, and ownership is split by path. Under
     capturable grammar the side-stream hostfunc advances them and the
     commit path deliberately does not; under eager grammar the data plane
     reads them during the fill and the commit path advances them, so the
     loop drains its in-flight queue before dispatching a grammar batch
     (``EventLoop._dispatch_depends_on_pending_commit`` is the registry of
     those drain rules). Copying a matcher per round is not free, which is
     why this stays an exception rather than becoming rule 2.

   - Multimodal items. The gather's snapshot is shallow on purpose: the
     ``MultimodalDataItem`` objects stay shared, and the data plane WRITES
     through them mid-forward — the embedder fills ``item.encoded`` and
     drops the raw ``feature``/``feature_shm`` it no longer needs, and EPD
     publishes ``encoded`` via the handle's embedding slot. The discipline
     is ordering, not freezing: mutations happen on the FIFO (inside the
     forward, or a submitted closure), the control plane only reads them at
     commit time or later, and the release of the shared SHM handles rides
     the FIFO too (``run_multimodal_work`` with ``wait=False``) so it lands
     behind any forward still reading them. What the shallow copy does
     freeze is the OUTER struct — ``mrope_positions`` and its siblings,
     which the control plane rebinds every round.
