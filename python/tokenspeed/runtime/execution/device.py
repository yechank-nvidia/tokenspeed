"""The control plane's entire handle on the GPU.

``ModelExecutor`` owns the device: the execution stream, the runtime states,
the input buffers, the CUDA graphs, the attention backends and their forward
metadata. All of it must be touched by one thread — the forward thread — or
two threads race on one stream and a control-plane write lands in the middle
of a forward's own writes. Neither failure crashes; both surface much later
as a wrong token.

So the event loop does not hold a ``ModelExecutor``. It holds one of these,
and the operations below are the complete list of what it can do to the GPU.
(The PD transfer peer is the one object it also holds directly, for the
control-plane half of the transport — bootstrap, event polling; its
execution half is reached only through this handle.)
Each one packages its arguments into a closure and hands that closure to the
forward thread; there is no accessor here for the executor, a backend, a
buffer, or a stream. The rule "the control plane issues no CUDA work, and
what it hands over it does not touch again" therefore does not need to be
remembered or asserted — the loop cannot reach anything it could violate it
with. What it cannot see, it cannot change.

``build_device_side`` is why that holds at construction too. The model
runners, the attention backends and the KV pools are locals of that function
and the loop never names them, so it cannot keep one by accident. Startup
itself runs on the building thread, before the forward thread has any work,
which is why weight loading, autotuning and CUDA graph capture can touch the
device directly in there.

What comes back is one ``DeviceBuild``, split by how long the caller may
hold each piece:

- ``DeviceSpecs`` — plain values the control plane plans with (cache
  geometry, speculation widths, capability flags). No device object, safe to
  keep forever, and reading one never goes through the handle.
- ``transfer`` — the PD transfer peer's CONTROL face (bootstrap
  register/abort, event polling), or None outside PD. Built here too: its
  execution face lives inside the handle, and everything its construction
  needs is ``server_args`` or an object this builder already owns.
- ``encoder_model_facts`` — a startup-only callable for EPD admission,
  resolved past its gate because a text-only model has no vision tower.
- ``DeviceHandle`` — the running handle, and the only piece the loop stores.

Startup steps that need a real device object (the layerwise step counter,
the peer's KV description) happen INSIDE the builder, so no such object ever
comes back out. A new device interaction belongs in here if it runs once at
startup, and on ``DeviceHandle`` only if the running loop genuinely needs it
— the second widens what the loop can do to the GPU mid-flight.

See ``forward_thread.py`` for the capture contract each closure must satisfy.
